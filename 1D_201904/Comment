About this version:

Interface kernels updated: 
Correctly coupled the associated neighbor variable.

(1) InterfaceForce_sd_2_ld, InterfaceForce_sd_2_lp, use the following:

    _coupled_s_p(coupledNeighborValue("coupled_s_p")),


(2) InterfaceForce_sp can be used for s_p --> l_d because it has already coupled s p to neighborvalue in input file:

    neighbor_var = S_precipitate
