Testing hand-coded Jacobian, if the ratio is
O(1.e-8), the hand-coded Jacobian is probably correct.
Run with -snes_test_display to show difference
of hand-coded and finite difference Jacobian.


without onJac or Offjac:

Norm of matrix ratio 0.752571, difference 544688. (user-defined state)
Norm of matrix ratio 3.74055e-10, difference 0.000270729 (constant state -1.0)
Norm of matrix ratio 0.752514, difference 544647. (constant state 1.0

with onJac (with or without Offjac, same):
Norm of matrix ratio 0.752571, difference 544688. (user-defined state)
Norm of matrix ratio 3.74055e-10, difference 0.000270729 (constant state -1.0)
Norm of matrix ratio 0.470404, difference 385818. (constant state 1.0)
